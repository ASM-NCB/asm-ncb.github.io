### Dr. Michael Ibba, The Ohio State University
Michael Ibba is Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Co-Director of an NIH-sponsored graduate training program in Cellular and Molecular Biochemistry at Ohio State University.  He obtained an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from Imperial College in London and his Ph.D. degree at the University of Manchester.  He undertook both industrial and academic post-docs in Switzerland and the United States before going on to set up his own independent research group.  After starting out as a faculty member in Copenhagen, Denmark, Mike moved to the Department of Microbiology at Ohio State University where his lab now works on various aspects of microbial protein synthesis and antibiotic resistance.  His research has uncovered novel mechanisms of quality control in protein synthesis, and unexpected connections between the protein synthesis machinery and other cellular processes.  He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 

### Dr. Pat Schlievert, University of Iowa
He is Professor and Department Executive Officer of the Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. He is also Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of the small pharmaceutical company Hennepin Life Sciences.  Dr. Schlievert and his clinical colleagues have described the causes of 19 newly recognized infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These include the first description, in 1981 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, of toxic shock syndrome toxin, the major cause of the tampon-associated toxic shock syndrome in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 1987, Drs. Larry Cone and Schlievert provided the first description of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (also known as the “flesh-eating streptococcal disease”) and its cause in the New England Journal of Medicine. Most recently, he and his colleagues have proposed that S. aureus and its superantigens are important causes/contributors to development of diabetes mellitus type II. Dr. Schlievert has focused attention on development of dual-acting anti-infectives, including glycerol monolaurate (GML). GML is a generally recognized as safe compound that is both broadly antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory, thus the name dual-acting. Through the University of Iowa and Hennepin Life Sciences, it is Dr. Schlievert’s hope that GML, as a dual-acting anti-infective, can significantly reduce these infections. In addition to Dr. Schlievert’s scientific accomplishments, he has trained 27 graduate students and 19 postdoctoral associates. He has received multiple teaching awards for his teaching of graduate and medical students, including being recognized the 2016 American Society for Microbiology Graduate and Medical Teacher of the Year.

### Dr. Elitza Theel, The Mayo Clinic
Elli Theel completed her doctoral work in Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2010 and subsequently completed a fellowship in Clinical Microbiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN in 2012.  Dr. Theel is certified by the American Board of Medical Microbiology and is currently the director of the Infectious Diseases Serology laboratory at Mayo Clinic and an Assistant Professor of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.  

### Dr. Kim Brogden, University of Iowa 
Kim A. Brogden is the Director, Iowa Institute for Oral Health Research and Professor, Department of Periodontics in the College of Dentistry at the University of Iowa. He attended Iowa State University for his BS, MS, and PhD degrees and worked as a Microbiologist and Research Leader at the USDA, ARS, NADC for 29 years.  Dr. Brogden has over 40 years of experience in microbiology and immunology and currently has authored and co-authored over 26 books and book chapters; 170 peer reviewed journal articles; and 4 patents and provisional patents. His current research focuses on predictive computational simulation models for cancer, defensins as regulators of chemokine and cytokine production, and lipids as antimicrobial agents.

### Dr. John Bannantine, USDA-ARS
Dr. Bannantine received a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 1988 and went on to perform graduate work at Iowa State University.  While there, he earned a Master of Science degree in 1991 working on genetics of Staphylococcus aureus then and a PhD in 1995 analyzing transcriptional signals in Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis.  He held two postdoctoral positions studying the pathogenesis of the obligate intracellular parasite Chlamydia at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana and then at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  He is currently working as a principle investigator at the National Animal Disease Center, a USDA Agricultural Research Facility in Ames, Iowa. 


### Dr. Elizabeth Rucks, University of South Dakota
Dr. Rucks received her B.S. from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC. She obtained her PhD from Dr. Joan C. Olson’s lab at West Virginia University in 2005. She developed her current research program, examining eukaryotic SNARE interactions at the chlamydial inclusion, while a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Ted Hackstadt’s lab at the NIAID Rocky Mountain Laboratory. Since she started her faculty position at The University of South Dakota in 2010, she has received a K22, R15, and an R01. Recently, Dr. Rucks was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor.
